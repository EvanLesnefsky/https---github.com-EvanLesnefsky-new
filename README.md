Jetpack Shooter

## Project Description
I aim to create an Iron Man-inspired first-person shooter where players navigate through levels using flight mechanics. Players will control a character equipped with thrusters for aerial mobility and a gun for combat. The game will feature multiple levels with increasing difficulty, enemy AI, and interactive environments. To enhance immersion, the game will include particle effects for thrusters, impact effects for weapons, sci-fi sound effects, and a futuristic HUD interface inspired by Iron Man's suit display. The core gameplay loop focuses on mastering aerial combat while managing thruster power and weapon systems.

## Feature Breakdown
1. Flight System: Implement thruster-based flight mechanics with physics controls
    * Estimated Challenge - 4: Achieving smooth, intuitive flight controls while balancing fun and challenge will require careful tuning.
2. Shooting Mechanics: Weapon system with targeting, projectiles, and hit detection
    * Estimated Challenge - 3: Basic shooting mechanics are straightforward, but implementing accurate hit detection and weapon variety will take time.
3. Visual Effects: Particle systems for thrusters, weapon impacts, and explosions
    * Estimated Challenge - 3: Creating polished effects will require iteration and optimization.
4. GUI Interface: Dynamic heads-up display showing health, thruster power, and weapon status
    * Estimated Challenge - 4: Creating a responsive, aesthetic UI that matches the Iron Man theme while being functional.
5. Enemy AI: Basic enemy behavior with movement and attack patterns
    * Estimated Challenge - 5: Implementing smart, challenging AI that works in 3D space with flying mechanics.
6. Level Design: Multiple levels with increasing complexity and objectives
    * Estimated Challenge - 3: Building engaging levels that complement the flight mechanics.
